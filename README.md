# Ardit Berisha

I’m not just a Software Engineer. While others sleep, I work on ideas that matter — turning vision into reality and building tech for everyone. With **Amaro Than** we’re creating community power; Roma will be different, and I’m proud we’re building that future. Design matters: it’s not just how it looks, it’s how it works. Think different.

**CTO @ amarothan.com • Co-founder (Old Tubify) • Open Source AI Explorer • Full-stack Developer**

I build intelligent systems, scalable backends, and practical ML tooling. I’ve spent ~10 years building production services, training and fine-tuning models, and shipping apps. I research and experiment with AI, from training models from scratch to fine-tuning for production.
