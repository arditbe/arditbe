#  Ardit Berisha

**CTO @ amarothan.com • Co-founder (Old Tubify) • Open Source AI Explorer • Full-stack Developer**

I build intelligent systems, scalable backends, and practical ML tooling. I’ve spent ~10 years building random stuff you can find in my repositories — from production services to training and fine-tuning models. I research and experiment with AI, and I enjoy training models from scratch (like teaching a kid) as well as fine-tuning them for production tasks.

## 🌌 What I do / Areas of expertise

- **AI & Research:** model training, fine-tuning, dataset curation, NLP, applied research  
- **Full-stack Development:** frontend + backend systems, production APIs, performance & scaling  
- **Frontend & Apps:** React, native app development, AJAX integration  
- **Data & Ops:** databases (SQL), deployment, CI/CD, Docker, Linux

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- CTO at **amarothan.com** — building infrastructure and AI products.  
- Co-founder of **Old Tubify** — startup experience across product & ops.  
- ~**10 years** coding experience — many public repos and experimental projects.  
- Hands-on **AI researcher**: I train, fine-tune, debug models and build training pipelines.

## 🛠 Tech Snapshot

- Model work: dataset engineering, tokenization, training loops, fine-tuning pipelines  
- Frontend & apps: React, native mobile patterns, responsive UI, AJAX-driven flows  
- Backend: scalable APIs, SQL databases, background workers, logging & monitoring  
- Infrastructure: Docker, Linux, CI/CD, deployment automation

---

## 🧭 How I work

- Prototype fast, iterate often — experiments first, production second.  
- Prefer simple, auditable systems that scale: readable code, automated tests, monitoring.  
- Data-driven decisions: evaluate models and services with real metrics and small AB tests.  
- Teach & learn: I document training recipes and treat model training like teaching a human — repeat, correct, reward.
